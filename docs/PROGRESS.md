  - [x] 1-Click Payout Approval: Admin & Secretary review pending sales and approve with one click, depositing to consultant wallet(s) immediately.

  - [x] Direct Route 404 Resolution: Converted all relative internal links to absolute `${baseUrl}/dashboard/...` and added instant fallback redirect pages (`/sales/`, `/wallet/`, `/co-filing/`, `/leads/`).
  - [x] Client Base URL Injection: Global `window.__BASE_URL__` injected in `DashboardLayout.astro` for dynamic client-side links.
  - [x] All 17 automated tests passing; clean static build with 28 static HTML routes.
